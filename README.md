Cplusplus_Program

This project tasked me with providing the user options for finding the number of times that an item appeared in a .txt file. Therefore, this program primarily served as a lesson in inputting and outputting information from a C++ program to and from a .txt file.

I'm particularly happy with how much I minimized the main.cpp file which should increase the reusability and adaptability of the code. Minimizing main.cpp also made the program easier to maintain and read.

With that said, there are some advancements that I could make to enhance the code. Most notably, as it stands, if the user enters a string of multiple characters when prompted for an integer, the program breaks. Future iterations of the program should account for such possible errors.

The most challenging aspect of this project was the use of maps and iteration. These two ideas weren't explicitly taught in the course and required further research to understand. Although the zyBooks textbook had sections that helped in this regard, further research was still required (especially for understanding maps). I primarily utilized the following resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/. This resource will be added to my support network.
